			<p>Git, my sweetheart,<br> 

				How I made it this far without your support is a mystery to me. You are the most exquisite versioning system to ever exist, and when I’m with you I know that I will be secure and safe, but always have the freedom to change. While you have such a complex and and intricate interior, you make everything simple for me. As I update my files you take snapshots of each version for me, like an eternal scrapbook of our love. You have provided an excellent source of organization in my life and helped me to maintain and improve upon my creations. </p>
			<p>
				I admit, when I first was introduced to you I was quite intimidated. Even with my hesitation, I went to https://git-scm.com and installed your software onto my computer. The process proved to be easy, I just followed the prompts given, and thus you were now on my laptop. Giddy with excitement and anticipation, I opened up my terminal and our love affair began. </p>

			<p>
				To start the process you have to get into the desired directory. Once there, the magic begins. To make this directory a repository we simply type “git init,” which allows us to have a versioning system for this directory. With this command, you create a secret file for me, the .git file, which is hidden to the naked eye but revealed with our secret password, the command ls -la. From here we can create files, add files, or create versions that will be stored here. Once I have created a new file, or updated one, say an index page, we can stage it through the command git add (followed by the file name OR a period, the . allows you to add all files that have been changed or added). To see if this has worked you have created the wonderful command git status. Once I type this, you color code the file names for me. Green means that the file is successfully in staging, red means that I have not added this file yet. From here I can choose to commit files, which is what saves the file, like a snapshot. The full command is git commit -m “put your message here.” The quotes is where I insert my love notes to you, describing what changes I made; this makes it convenient for anyone else collaborating on the project. But, when I need to take a step back and reevaluate my commitment, you don’t hold it against me. I can easily take a step back by typing git checkout filename. </p>
				<p>Forever yours, <br> Caitlin</p>
